## Key Documentation Sections

### Project Overview (README.md)

The README provides a high-level overview of the OpenSVM Mobile application, including:

- Project description and purpose
- Key features and capabilities
- Setup and installation instructions
- Project structure overview
- Technology stack

This is the best starting point for new users and contributors to understand what the project is about.

### Architecture Documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md)

The architecture documentation provides a detailed explanation of:

- Application architecture and design patterns
- Directory structure and organization
- Data flow between components
- State management approach
- Key features implementation details

This document is valuable for developers who need to understand how the application is structured and how different components interact.

### Visual Diagrams (DIAGRAMS.md)

The diagrams document contains visual representations of:

- Application architecture
- Data flow diagrams
- Component hierarchies
- State management flows
- User journey flows
- Technology stack

These diagrams help visualize complex relationships and processes within the application.

### Knowledge Graphs (KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md)

The knowledge graphs document provides conceptual maps of:

- Core application concepts
- Technology stack relationships
- Solana blockchain concepts
- User journeys
- Data relationships
- SIMD-0228 proposal concepts
- Application architecture
- Future integration possibilities

This document helps understand the conceptual relationships between different aspects of the application and the Solana ecosystem.

### Development Roadmap (ROADMAP.md)

The roadmap document outlines:

- Current project status
- Short-term development goals (1-3 months)
- Medium-term development goals (3-6 months)
- Long-term development goals (6+ months)
- Technical debt and infrastructure plans
- Community and feedback initiatives
- Milestone timeline

This document is useful for understanding the project's direction and planned features.
